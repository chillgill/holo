    Holocentric supports an XML-based API that is based on OData and works with an XSD. 
    The API supports a single RESTful service that can query and return item content.
    All API access is performed over HTTPS and accessed from a variable URI based on client installations and libraries. 
    The API version 1.0 and as an original release is not a factor in the base URI.
