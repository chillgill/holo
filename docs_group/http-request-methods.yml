    The BMS REST API strives to use appropriate HTTP methods for each action:
    
    | Method        | Action        |
    | ------------- |---------------|
    | `HEAD`     | Retrieve HTTP header information for one or more resources. Do not rely on this information between requests. |
    | `GET`      | Retrieve one or more resources.   |   
    | `POST` | Create a resource or perform a custom action.     |    Currently only for authorization purposes
    | `PATCH` | Partially update a resource.    |    Not currently used
    | `PUT` |Completely replace a resource.     |    Not currently used  
    | `DELETE` | Delete a resource.      |    Not currently used
